          <p>Cryptid is the next generation of identification. Current identification methods such as state issued driver's licenses are insecure and easily tampered with. Cryptid eliminates the possibility of counterfeit identification by adding factors of identification and encryption that is backed by a distributed, global network. Oh, and did we mention we're open source?</p>

          <h2>Decentralized</h2>
          By utilizing the power of the block chain, no one authority holds access to your identity. Instead the data is distributed across many computers, which prevents corruption and makes it nearly impossible for your identity data to be tampered with. Conventional identification methods rely on a central authority such as a state government in order to assure your identity, making them vulnerable to hacking and corruption.

          <h2>Multiple Factors</h2>
          Cryptid uses three factor authentication to assure you are who you say you are. Traditional identification methods only require one factor of authentication which is the card that you have. Cryptid gives you the ability to use all three. The unique identifier is something you have, the password is something you know and your fingerprint is something you are. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">Learn more about multi factor authentication</a>

          <h2>Cuts Costs</h2>
          Since Cryptid doesn't require a physical identification card to prove your identity, we allow you to cut costs by allowing your identification media to be almost anything from a smart phone to a generic piece of paper -- anything that can store a QR code.
